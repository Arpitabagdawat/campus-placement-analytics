# Campus Placement Analytics 📊

An end-to-end data analytics project to analyze college campus placement trends using Python (Jupyter Notebook) and Power BI.

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes student academic performance, work experience, and specialization to understand:
- Placement rate
- Factors affecting placement
- Salary distribution for placed students

The final output is an interactive Power BI dashboard for insights and storytelling.

## 📁 Dataset

The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:
